FORFEITING MY MYSTIQUE - KAVEH AKBAR: 
Itâ€™s so unsettling to feel anything but good. I wish I was only as cruel as the first time I noticed I was cruel, waving my tiny shadow over a pond to scare the copper minnows.

THERE IS NO FRIGATE LIKE A BOOK - EMILY DICKINSON: 
This traverse may the poorest take , without oppress of toll, how frugal is the chariot that bears the human soul.

THE ANTHROPOCENE REVIEWED - JOHN GREEN:
- It's no wonder we worry about the end of the world; worlds end all the time.

- We all know how loving ends. But I want to fall in love with the world anyway, to let it crack me open. I want to feel what there is to feel while I am here.
