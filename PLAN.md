~ P L A N ~
OVERALL:
- deploy some ipsum to Heroku
- create an API that fetches ipsum from the Heroku database
- create a React app that displays the fetched ipsum into an interactive typing sample


---------------
CREATE THE REACT APP
x - create the skeleton / boilerplate
  - make the component tree flowchart
  - organise the file system
  - sort our the import / export syntax
  - add components
----------------

WHERE YOU'RE AT:
- tried to fix all the import / export syntax but have probably missed some
- tried to fix file system but probs got some wrong idk
- the app won't display, just says "module not found" for ./src/index.js
- I don't really have time to fix this today so let's hope I gain some insight that'll help me fix it faster next time lol.
- ~ an attempt was made ~
